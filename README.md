# OpenCV
I used OpenCV for  creating a filter and edge detection whereas OpenCV is a computer vision and machine learning software library that includes many common image analysis algorithms that will help us build custom, intelligent computer vision applications. To start with, this includes tools that help us process images and select areas of interest.
